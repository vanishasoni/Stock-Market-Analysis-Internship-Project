# Stock Market Analysis
# Project Overview
This is a simple yet complete **Stock Market Data Analysis** project prepared for internship portfolio use.
It contains exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, feature engineering, and a small baseline prediction model.

## Goals
1. Clean and explore the stock data.
2. Visualize price trends, moving averages, returns, and volume patterns.
3. Compute correlations and seasonality (if applicable).
4. Create simple features and build a baseline model to predict next-day Close price using Linear Regression.
5. Provide clear explanations so a reviewer (internship interviewer) can follow your thought process.

## Technologies Used
1. Python 3.10+
2. Pandas — data handling & manipulation
3. NumPy — numerical operations
4. Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly — data visualization
5. Scikit-learn — machine learning (Linear Regression model)
6. Jupyter Notebook — analysis and presentation

## Key Insights
1. Moving averages smooth short-term volatility and highlight long-term trends.
2. The daily returns distribution shows the stock’s volatility and risk level.
3. Volume trends indicate investor activity and market strength.
4. Correlation heatmaps reveal relationships between features.
5. The Linear Regression model achieves a good baseline accuracy for predicting next-day Close prices.
